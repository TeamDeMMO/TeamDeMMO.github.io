Micro‚Äêorganisms are the dominant lifeforms in this habitat, but the nature of their in situ activities remains largely unresolved. At the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) located in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota (USA), we performed in situ electrochemical incubations designed to assess the potential for deep groundwater microbial communities to utilize extracellular electron transfer to support microbial respiration. DeMMO 4 was chosen for its stable geochemistry and microbial community. Graphite and indium tin oxide electrodes poised at ‚àí200 mV versus SHE were incubated along with open circuit controls and various minerals in a parallel flow reactor that split access to fluids across different treatments. From the patterns of net current over time (fluctuating between anodic and cathodic currents over the course of a few days to weeks) and the catalytic features measured using periodic cyclic voltammetry, evidence of both oxidative and reductive microbe‚Äêelectrode interactions was observed. The predominant catalytic activity ranged from ‚àí210 to ‚àí120 mV. The observed temporal variability in electrochemical activity was unexpected given the documented stability in major geochemical parameters. This suggests that the accessed fluids are more heterogeneous in electrochemically active microbial populations than previously predicted from the stable community composition. As previously reported, the fracture fluid and surface‚Äêattached microbial communities at SURF differed significantly. However, only minimal differences in community composition were observed between poised potential electrodes, open circuit electrodes, and mineral incubations. These data support that in this environment the ability to attach to surfaces is a stronger driver of microbial community structure than the type or reactivity of the surface. We demonstrate that insight into specific activities can be gained from electrochemical methods, specifically chronoamperometry coupled with routine cyclic voltammetry, which provide a sensitive approach to evaluate microbial activities in situ.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Electrochemical evidence for in situ microbial activity at the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO), South Dakota, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caitlin Casar","Dr. Brittany Kruger","Dr. Theodore Flynn","Dr. Andrew Masterson","Dr. Lily Momper","Dr. Maggie Osburn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610929161,"objectID":"287cbfc6cdbf53417e8bb56f4a5bde96","permalink":"/publication/casar2020/","publishdate":"2020-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/casar2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep subsurface biofilms are estimated to host the majority of prokaryotic life on Earth, yet fundamental aspects of their ecology remain unknown. An inherent difficulty in studying subsurface biofilms is that of sample acquisition. While samples from marine and terrestrial deep subsurface fluids have revealed abundant and diverse microbial life, limited work has described the corresponding biofilms on rock fracture and pore space surfaces. The recently established Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) is a long‚Äêterm monitoring network at which we can explore the ecological role of biofilms in fluid‚Äêfilled fractures to depths of 1.5 km. We carried out in situ cultivation experiments with single minerals representative of DeMMO host rock to explore the ecological drivers of biodiversity and biomass in biofilm communities in the continental subsurface. Coupling cell densities to thermodynamic models of putative metabolic reactions with minerals suggests a metabolic relationship between biofilms and the minerals they colonize. Our findings indicate that minerals can significantly enhance biofilm cell densities and promote selective colonization by taxa putatively capable of extracellular electron transfer. In turn, minerals can drive significant differences in biodiversity between fluid and biofilm communities. Given our findings at DeMMO, we suggest that host rock mineralogy is an important ecological driver in deep continental biospheres.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Mineral‚Äêhosted biofilm communities in the continental deep subsurface, Deep Mine Microbial Observatory, SD, USA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Caitlin Casar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610928019,"objectID":"34f631b58be2d22c3c1b766e7ea1fc85","permalink":"/post/migrating/","publishdate":"2020-01-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/migrating/","section":"post","summary":"Howdy üëã We are currently migrating the DeMMO website, thanks for your patience!","tags":null,"title":"Welcome to the new DeMMO site!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Dr. Maggie Osburn","Dr. Brittany Kruger","Dr. Andrew Masterson","Caitlin Casar","Dr. Jan Amend"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1561939200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610936840,"objectID":"8ebec3b2b2a5a659e35fb7c9a6247f83","permalink":"/publication/osburn2019/","publishdate":"2019-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/osburn2019/","section":"publication","summary":"We established the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), Lead, SD, USA to sample naturally draining fracture fluids at six spatially distributed sites from the shallowest (800 ft) to the deepest accessible (4,850 ft) depths.

Given that the majority of prokaryotic life on Earth may exist in deep subsurface biofilms (Flemming and Wuertz, 2019), it is critical to understand the ecology of these communities to inform the search for life on Mars. Minerals are likely an important energy source for the deep continental biosphere in which oxygen and organic carbon are limited. However, microbe-mineral interactions in these environments are not well understood in part due to sampling challenges. The Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO) in Lead, South Dakota, offers a unique portal to the deep biosphere, providing access to fracture fluids that host microbial life to a depth of 4,850 ft (1478 m) (Osburn et al. 2017). This iron-rich Mars analog system consists of a diversity of minerals that may support microbial metabolisms. Biofilm formation on fracture surfaces may facilitate these metabolisms by allowing close contact between cells and minerals that is often required by microbes for extracellular electron transport (EET) (Shi et al. 2016). Here, we describe in situ cultivation experiments with minerals targeting mineral-hosted deep subsurface biofilm communities. **Methods:** An array of flow through colonization reactors were filled with minerals representative of DeMMO lithology (pyrite, hematite, magnetite, siderite, pyrolusite, muscovite, gypsum, and calcite) or inert control substrates (glass beads, glass wool, and sand). Reactors were connected to borehole outflows at three sites located at depths of 800, 2,000, and 4,850 ft for 2-8 months to allow for colonization by biofilm communities prior to harvesting. We identified biofilm community members using 16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Sequences were binned into operational taxonomic units and assigned taxonomy with QIIME (Caporaso et al. 2010) and the SILVA132 taxonomy reference database (Quast et al. 2012). We used scanning electron microscopy to document biofilm cell morphologies and estimate cell densities on polished mineral chips and glass slide controls. We interpret biofilm community composition and colonization patterns on each substrate in the context of thermodynamic models of metabolic reactions. Models were generated from DeMMO geochemical data using SPECE8 (Bethke et al. 2009) and CHNOSZ (Dick 2008). Results: Mineral experiments enriched for dramatically different communities than fluids and from inert control substrates, suggesting that members of the biofilms may be using minerals as both a surface for attachment and a metabolic energy source. Specifically, experiments with pyrolusite (MnO2) yielded the highest cell densities of all minerals types and enriched for members of the Desulfobulbaceae and Thermodesulfovibrionia. Further, sheath-like structures were observed on the pyrolusite which may play a role in EET. These results align with thermodynamic models of DeMMO metabolisms, which suggest that pyrolusite is a highly favorable electron acceptor, especially when coupled to the oxidation of elemental sulfur or hydrogen. Further, our community data suggest the attached vs. suspended lifestyles of several candidate divisions, including Latescibacteria (WS3) and Omnitrophica (OP3) which appear to be important members of the biofilm and fluid communities, respectively. **Conclusion:** Our in situ cultivation approach successfully targeted the growth of deep subsurface biofilm communities, offering insight into the metabolic and biomass potential of the terrestrial deep biosphere across a broad range of depths and geochemical conditions. Additionally, our results shed light on the lifestyles of candidate phyla that comprise microbial dark matter in the deep biosphere. We are working to further characterize DeMMO biofilm metabolisms and the potential for EET through laboratory-based cultivation experiments, CARD-FISH probing, and atomic force microscopy. Our findings underscore the potential for a mineral-hosted deep subsurface biosphere on Mars. **References:** Bethke, C. et al. (2009) Geochemist's Workbench: Release 8.0 GWB Essentials Guide.

The deep terrestrial subsurface is a key analog for subsurface settings on other rocky planets. In Earth‚Äôs deep subsurface biosphere (DSB), water, organic carbon and chemical energy are often scarce. However, it has been shown that archaea and bacteria are able to persist in the DSB to at least 3.5 km below surface [1]. Understanding how organisms persist, and what markers they may leave behind, is critical in predicting which extraterrestrial bodies may have harbored, or harbor, similar life. In the current study we investigated life down to 1.5 km below surface. Our portal to the DSB is a legacy gold mine in Lead, South Dakota‚Äînow home to the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO, consisting of six sample sites, 800-4850 feet below surface) hosted within a sulfide-rich, Paleoproterozoic iron-formation [2]. Previous work by our group used thermodynamic modeling from measured geochemistry to predict energy-yielding metabolic reactions and showed evidence for abundant exergonic chemolithoautotrophic metabolisms [3]. Here, we build upon that work by combining metagenomic sequences with geochemical and 16S rRNA gene sequences, culminating in 5 years of physical and biological data. Synthesizing these datasets of different types and from different time points provides a more holistic understanding of how life persists in Earth‚Äôs DSB, thereby enabling better prediction of what sorts of life may be in the subsurface of extraterrestrial bodies. Samples for this study were collected between September, 2013 and September, 2018 from boreholes located between 0-4850 feet (~1.5 km) below surface. On each expedition, geochemical data were collected concomitantly with DNA for 16S and/or metagenomic sequencing. **Results:** Preliminary 16S rRNA analyses revealed a change in microbial community composition as a function of depth, including a progression from Proteobacteria-dominated and candidate phyladominated communities near the surface to Firmicutesdominated communities at depth. Nearly 20 candidate phyla were identified in DeMMO fluids, which are divisions for which we have no cultured representative. Members of the OP3 (Ca. Omnitrophica) and Hadesarcheaeota were particularly abundant in fluids collected at 800 and 4850 feet deep, respectively. Further investigation using whole genomic DNA amplification- shotgun metagenomics- enabled complete and near-complete genome reconstruction of surface fluids flowing above DeMMO and fluids circulating within the subsurface. We reconstructed nearly 500 genomes from 8 fluid samples. In some cases, the metagenomic data recapitulated the 16S datasets, enabling us to reconstruct full genomes for abundant members, such as candidate phylum OP3. In other fluids we were able to construct complete genomes for members of the rare biosphere. For example, we reconstructed the most complete genome for candidate phylum NKB19 currently available [4]. Gene prediction and metabolic mapping revealed that putative anaerobic metabolisms, potentially using H2 as an electron donor, were very common. The transformation of oxidized and reduced sulfur and/or nitrogen species were also very common potential energy sources among genomes. Nearly half of the reconstructed genomes had all genes necessary for carbon fixation via the relatively energy inexpensive, and obligately anaerobic reductive acetylCoA pathway. In general, the phylogeny and metabolisms of genomes collected from the surface water above DeMMO were different from those found in fluids collected 800-4850 feet below surface and consisted mostly of aerobic and phototrophic metabolisms. Conversely, the majority of microbes in subsurface borehole fluids retain metabolic capability for chemolithotrophic and autotrophic metabolisms. These results, along with geochemical data and hydrologic modeling, lead us to conclude that the deeply circulating fluids at DeMMO have little if any continuity with the overlying surface fluids, supporting the possibility of subsurface life independent from the surface on other planetary bodies. **Broader implications:** Our study of microbial communities in a terrestrial subsurface setting informs the prediction about the location and possible biosignatures of communities on extraterrestrial bodies. Analyzing geochemical metadata with phylogenetic diversity and metagenomic metabolic mapping may enable us to predict what metabolic pathways would be likely in the subsurface of other potentially habitable planets such as Mars. **References:** [1] Baker J.

Extending from shallow aquifers to kilometers into the crust, the deep subsurface biosphere (DSB) contains as much organic carbon in biomass as the ocean, rivers, and lakes combined1,2. Key questions include: Who is there?, What are they doing?, and Are they dependent on the surface? To this end, we have established the Deep Mine Microbial Observatory (DeMMO), in the former Homestake Goldmine, USA. Here we continually monitor geochemistry and microbial diversity and can perform in situ experiments to query the DSB. Modern sequencing approaches can answer ‚ÄúWho?‚Äù. Our work and that of others suggest that the DSB is dominated by diverse communities of very unusual, uncultivated phyla3-5. Genomic analysis is one promising avenue to answer ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù as genomes contain the blueprints for microbial activity. Genomes obtained from subsurface organisms range from encoding diverse metabolic capability, presumably to use sparse and/or variable resources (e.g. Desulforudis and Abyssubacteria)6,7 to those with very reduced genomes indicative of syntrophic or parasitic lifestyles5. Another approach we are taking to answer ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù is geochemical, using thermodynamics to determine which metabolisms are profitable and isotopic analyses to track the flow of elements through microbial processes. At DeMMO a large array of sulfur, iron, manganese, and nitrogen-based metabolisms are energy yielding and microbes have shown an increased ability to tap directly into electrons for energy4,8. This abundance of chemical energy sources, independent of surficial organic carbon, opens the possibility of independent subsurface ecosystems on Earth and beyond9. 1. McMahon, S. \u0026 Parnell, J.

The subsurface offers protection from environmental stressors (i.e. extreme temperatures and radiation) that may exist on the surface of extraterrestrial bodies, and has the potential both for liquid water [1] and fuel for lithotrophic metabolisms [2]. Furthermore, biofilms that colonize fluid-filled fractures create microenvironments that aid survival under otherwise extreme conditions. These communities may represent a significant fraction of subsurface life [3]. To better understand these systems, we characterize rock-hosted biofilm communities from a deep, iron and sulfur-rich Mars analogue site. The Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) is located at the former Homestake gold mine in Lead, South Dakota. The mine is currently accessible to a depth of 1,480 meters. Legacy boreholes intersecting fluid-filled fractures provide access to deep fluids that host lithotrophic microbial life [4]. Geochemical analyses show these fluids to be somewhat heterogeneous, with locally high concentrations of ammonia, nitrate, sulfide, sulfate, iron, and manganese. The geochemistry of these fluids ranges from oxidizing to highly reducing, with pH neutral to slightly alkaline and temperatures from 10-30 ÀöC. While planktonic microbial communities within borehole fluids have been previously described [4]; biofilm communities within these fractures have yet to be characterized. Here we describe a novel approach to culturing interstitial biofilms in situ using artificial substrates. In addition, we present the results of ongoing efforts to isolate and describe the metabolic capabilities of novel organisms in the laboratory, specifically those capable of respiring ferric oxide minerals. **Field Experiments:** Sampling borehole fluids by filtering suspended cells captures only planktonic members of the microbial community, which may be only a small fraction of the deep subsurface microbiome [3]. We therefore designed flow-through samplers to target the attached communities and mitigate bias introduced by laboratory cultivation from fluid samples. Borehole fluids were directed into gas-tight glass cartridges filled with sterilized sand, Pyrex beads, and glass wool. Fluids exiting the cartridges flowed over a set of glass slides exposed to the mine atmosphere. Biofilms grown on these substrates can then be directly characterized using a broad array of analytical techniques including metagenomics, microscopy, C/N ratios, lipid extraction and profiling, and Raman spectroscopy. In doing so, we can link the community composition of the biofilms with associated mineral assemblages, microstructure, and biosignature composition as well as the geochemistry of the associated borehole fluids. A second array of cartridges filled with hematite, pyrite, and magnetite will be deployed in February 2017 to enrich for iron and sulfur-associated biofilms. Preliminary observations indicate geochemical controls on biofilm formation, as black (likely reduced) biofilms within cartridges transitioned to red biofilms in the cartridge outflow under the oxygenated mine atmosphere. The thickest accumulations of biofilms were formed on glass wool cartridges, indicating surface textural controls on biofilm formation. Whole community Œ¥13C values of biofilms suggest both organic and inorganic carbon are incorporated into microbial biomass. **Lab Experiments:** Many of the 16S rRNA gene sequences obtained from SURF have no closelyrelated relatives among organisms that have been previously isolated [4]. We attempt to shed light on the metabolic roles of these uncultivated organisms by using media designed to mimic in situ geochemical conditions. Abundant iron oxides are available at SURF; however, these insoluble substrates require specialized metabolic strategies. Batch cultivation experiments targeting anaerobic, heterotrophic and autotrophic iron reducers were inoculated with fluids collected from depths of 610 and 1,480 meters. Ferrihydrite, organic carbon, and hydrogen served as electron acceptors and donors. Isolate characterization includes microscopy and DNA sequencing to determine cell morphology, microbe-mineral associations, and taxonomy. Additional experiments will employ biofilms collected from field experiments as inocula. Preliminary results indicate SURF microorganisms are capable of reducing ferric iron minerals. However, whether the iron is being actively or passively reduced remains unclear. Precipitates formed on glass walls of culture tubes are strikingly similar to those observed in cartridge experiments. **References:** [1] Michalski et al. (2013) Nature Geoscience, 6, 133-138.

Access to the subsurface is often transient, however, and involves major disruptions to the very environments we seek to study. To overcome these challenges we have established a network of six packered boreholes that serve as stable sampling ports at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF), South Dakota, USA. Our network extends from 250-1500 m below the surface, allowing access to deep subsurface fluids across a large range of ages and compositions. By tapping these directly, we are poised to install long-term experimental apparatus and conduct targeted experiments to further characterize the ecology and physiology of Earth‚Äôs deepest inhabitants. **Methods:** The deep subsurface of SURF has been previously shown to contain diverse microbial life and geochemical potential [1, 2]. We selected the DeMMO sites from a subset of previously-studied boreholes while including two new sites, at 610 m and 1250 m, to provide additional coverage across the depth gradient. Each site exhibits consistent water outflow rates, limited evidence for subsurface interaction with mine workings, and is regularly accessible. We capped each borehole using custom designed and machined expandable packers composed of high-density plastic (Delrin) and polyurethane rather than the standard stainless steel manifolds because these latter corrode rapidly in the subsurface, affecting both their lifespan and the geochemical integrity of the associated waters, thereby also affecting native microbial community structure. Prior to packering, boreholes were drilled out and reamed to remove old concrete plugs and create a stable surface against which the packers could seal. Drilling and packer installation was carried out at 3 of 6 DeMMO holes (DeMMO 3, 4, and 5) from May to July 2016. Geochemical and microbiological monitoring of fluids from each site began prior to hole modification and has continued since on an approximately bimonthy basis. Analyses include major cations and anions, redox sensitive solutes (DO, Fe2+, NO3 - , NH4 + , S2- ), DIC, DOC, dissolved gas composition, water isotopes, and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes of cells filtered from borehole fluids. **Results:** Continued monitoring of DeMMO boreholes from December 2015 to December 2016 has identified each site as a unique and stable biogeochemical island. Geochemistry. Geochemical data reveal consistent fluid compositions at individual stations. Similar compositions of nonreactive ions between sets of boreholes suggest that each pair of sites is hydrologically connected. This observation is consistent with the spatial orientation of the boreholes and expected hydrologic flow paths. There is no apparent seasonal trend in either flow rate or major element chemistry, consistent with the long residence time of these fluids in the subsurface. A gradient of decreasing DOC with depth is consistent with the gradual consumption of surfacederived organic matter by native microbes. *Microbiology.* DNA sequencing of borehole fluids revealed significant microbial diversity within the SURF site as well as substantial differences between boreholes. Drilling was found to impart a significant but transient perturbation to the microbial community in a particular borehole. Holes that were not subjected to drilling display a remarkably consistent community composition over the course of months. Significant populations of candidate phyla (e.g. OP3) and deeply divergent strains of known phyla are present at most sites. Of the sequences from characterized phyla, those most closely related to microbes involved in sulfur and iron cycling are well-represented as are relatives of known thermophiles. Continued monitoring of all sites will allow us to evaluate the longer-term impact of drilling on the deep subsurface microbiome as well as further illuminate the connections between geochemistry and microbiology in this unique environment. Experiments aimed at culturing and characterizing microbial inhabitants are underway at a number of DeMMO sites. In particular, we are interested in replicating the intra-fracture biofilm community by cultivating microorganisms on solid substrates using flowthrough columns as well as more traditional approaches using synthetic growth media. **Future directions:** We aim to establish collaborations at other deep subsurface research sites, most notably in the South African and Canadian Shields, to establish nodes of DeMMO worldwide. **References:** [1] Osburn M.
