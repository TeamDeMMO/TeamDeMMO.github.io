      <description>&lt;p&gt;Biofilms are thin, slimy films of microbes like bacteria and archaea that adhere to fracture surfaces at DeMMO. Living in a biofilm has lots of potential advantages in the deep subsurface, such as making it easier to access nutrients, exchange DNA with other microbes nearby, or getting closer to a tasty mineral in the rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We deploy in situ cultivation experiments at DeMMO boreholes to target the growth of biofilm communities. These ongoing experiments will shed light on which microbes can eat minerals in the rocks at DeMMO. Minerals are likely an important source of energy for life in the rocky subsurface on Earth, and could also be an energy source in extraterrestrial rocky subsurface environments. Understanding the role that minerals play in subsurface habitability at DeMMO will inform our understanding of habitability on other planets like Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image below is a scanning electron micrograph of a DeMMO biofilm on a mineral surface. The cells are about 1 micron in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lipids are a major focus for biomarker detection on other planets because they are the dominant component of microbial cell membranes and they persist in the terrestrial rock record over billion-year timescales. It is important to characterize lipids produced by microbes living in environments on Earth that are analogous to environments on other planets to inform the search for extraterrestrial life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We capture microbes suspended in DeMMO fracture fluids on filters, and from the filters we extract bulk lipids from the microbial communities.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We culture microbes collected from DeMMO under controlled laboratory conditions. Through our culture experiments, we are able to characterize metabolic function in DeMMO communities. We are working to isolate important members of the communities so that we can describe their specific roles in detail. This work requires specialized equipment because the fracture fluids are anoxic. We use an anaerobic Coy chamber and mix our own gases with a custom-built gas manifold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experiments target both microbes suspended in fluids and in biofilms. The image below shows continuous flow experiments targeting DeMMO biofilms on native host rock.&lt;/p&gt;
